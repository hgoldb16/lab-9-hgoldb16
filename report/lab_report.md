# Laboratory XX
## Full Name Here <br> Date:  MM/DD/YYYY

This is the format for the lab report.  Everyone should follow this format.  Start by these introductory paragraphs and following the document structure described below.  A finished lab report should have the instructions removed and lab report filled in.  Do not delete the "Instructor Note" section at the bottom of the report.

This document is written in (and should continue to be written in) [GitHub Flavored Markdown](../supporting/GitHub_Flavored_Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.md).  Students may use any tool for editing the Markdown document, from simple text editors like *vi* or *notebook*, to specialized software for Markdown documents, like *MacDown*.  *STM32CubeIDE* has a Markdown plugin that can be downloaded from the Eclipse Marketplace.  It's easy to use and has a document previewer as well.

Students who create well formatted, well documented, concise, and intelligible reports will tend to receive "3" scores.  Do not overdo it.  The point of the experiments is to get experience with microcontrollers, programming, and interfacing.  Be thorough, but concise.  Use a spell checker.  Proof your reports.

### Summary

This section should have a concise summary of the laboratory, including its overall objectives.  Connecting the lab objectives to the reading and lecture materials in the module will go into the "above and beyond" category.  Concise means a couple of paragraphs.

## Experiment Y

Each lab will have one or more experiments associated with it.  Each experiment should have it's own section and follow the same format.  That format includes:

### Parts List

List of parts needed for the laboratory (not including software).  If there are no parts associated with the laboratory, then "None" should be put in this section.  The section should use a bulleted list to list the parts.

### Schematic

Many of the experiments will have a schematic, which includes drawing how the hardware gets interfaced to the microcontroller.  If there is no schematic for a laboratory, then "None" should be put in that section.  Schematics may be computer drawn or hand drawn, but always legible and well labeled.  Don't make the instructor guess what you mean.

### Procedure

A concise description of the procedure is required.  Snippets of code are welcome, but do not put the entire C file here.  Snippets and blocks to illustrate how something is done is preferred.  Code *must* be displayed either as inline code or in a code block.  For one line of code, use "Inline" code markdown.  For multiple lines of code, use "Fenced Code Block" markdown. See the [cheat sheet](../supporting/GitHub_Flavored_Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.md) for how to include code in the document.  Properly displayed code is part of the "minimum" requirement.

### Flowchart/State Diagram

This section should contain a detailed [flowchart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) or [state diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) (default to a flowchart unless specifically told in the assignment to draw a state diagram).  The detailed flowchart may be computer generated or hand drawn.  All flowcharts should be well labeled.  Hand drawn flowcharts should be legible and in the correct orientation to read in the document.

### Results

Finally, the last section should contain results of the experiment and any of the questions that may be in the assignment.  Photos and screenshots should be included here and should be put in the `media` directory within the `report` directory.  You should *not* put video in your repository.  Videos can be sent directly to the instructor on Teams or placed on YouTube (marked private) and a link placed in the report.  This should all be well document in the Results section.  

## Conclusions

This is where the student will draw some conclusions about the experiments and their experience with the experiments.  This section should be concise and may have commentary on the ease or difficulty of the overall laboratory.  The instructor takes this section seriously and has modified laboratories in the past based on input from students from their respective lab reports.
